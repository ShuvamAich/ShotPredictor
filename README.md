# ShotPredictor
A Basketball Shot Predictor using OpenCV

This is a project done my me isnpired by the game of Basketball. It uses a Quadratic Equation in the backend to produce a curve/ generate a projectile that the ball will follow. 
If the curve shows that it ends inside the circumference of the ring, our shot predictor gives a high accuracy and predicts that the shot will go in. Otherwise if the curve ends at the edges or outside the ring,
the shot accuracy is less and the chances of making the shot becomes further low.
